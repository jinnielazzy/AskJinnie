# AskJinnie

Hey,

Jinhua created me for a more convenient way to checkout issues and prs that are related to him. So far, I can only see issues and prs, not smart, hope to be smarter in the future.

Steps:

### Before create `.env` to store github domains, organization, repo names (separate by ',')

```
$ npm install # install dependencies
```

```
$ chmod u+x index.js # make it executable
```

```
$ ./index.js
```

or what Jinhua uses

```
# add an alias in shell such as ./bashrc or ./zshrc
alias AskJinnie=~/ask_jinnie/index.js
```
then run it
```
$ askjinnie
```
